        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jennifer Ragay. I am eighteen years old and I currently attend the University of California, Riverside where I am studying anthropology. I am looking to pursue a career in either archaeology or forensic anthropology. I play on the softball team here, as a second baseman. It is my first year at the university, as I graduated high school in 2023. <br><br>

        I have little work experience due to my age as well as being a student-athlete throughout my academic career. However, for the two most recent summers I have had a summer job. At Mount San Antonio College, I was a proctor for their College 4 Kids program. In this program, they provide summer school and recreational daycare for children in third through eighth grade. The job of proctoring required me to answer questions that parents had about the program, help children sign in, walk them to and from class, and act as a teacher's assistant in the class I was assigned.
        <br><br>

        This experience was very essential in developing my skills with children as well as giving me experience teaching. I have assisted teaching in academic classes as well as culinary classes which highlight my versatility in teaching.
